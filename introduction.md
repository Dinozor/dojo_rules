Everybody call me Dino.
Started on CodeSchool with Shaping Sharp with AngularJS (JavaScript).
Liked it so much that now I'm studying everything.
For now GitHub is my favorite, but haven't tried everything yet.
deadly_skills everything IT (front/back end, hardcoding, controller programming, game dev, etc.).
